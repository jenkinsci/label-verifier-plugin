    <p>
    Whenever an agent comes online with this label, verify the label is correct.
    </p>

    <p>
    Because labels are configured manually, it is possible for assigned labels to get out of sync with the reality on the agent.
    This kind of error can be typically only detected by having some builds fail, or worse, it can go completely unnoticed.
    </p>

    <p>
    By checking this checkbox, Jenkins will check whenever an agent comes online with this label.
    The check logic is extensible.
    Plugins can expand the types of checks available.
    </p>

    <p>
    When a check fails, the agent is marked offline.
    The administrator must reconfigure the label assignment before the agent can be used by Jenkins.
