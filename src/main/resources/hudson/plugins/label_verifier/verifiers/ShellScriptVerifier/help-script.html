<div>
  Runs a shell script to verify that this label assignment is correct.
  If the script exits with a non-zero return code, the label is considered invalid, and the agent will be marked offline.

  <p>
  The remote file system root of the agent is the working directory for the script.
  If the script has no header line like <code>#!/bin/sh</code>, then the shell configured system-wide will be used.
  The header line can be configured to write script in another language (like <code>#!/bin/perl</code>).
  The header line can be configured control the shell options used in the script.
  </p>

  <p>
  By default, the shell will be invoked with the <code>-ex</code> option.
  Commands are printed before being executed and the script is considered a failure if any of the commands exits with a non-zero exit code.
  Add options to the <code>#!/bin/...</code> line to change this behavior.
